## Technical Requirements

```md
1. Use vanilla JavaScript without any frameworks.
2. Implement a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
3. Use local storage to persist task data.
4. Implement proper form validation for task creation and editing.
5. Use ES6+ features such as arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals.
6. Implement error handling to manage potential issues (e.g., local storage unavailable).
7. Ensure the application is accessible, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
8. Optimize performance by minimizing DOM manipulation and using event delegation where appropriate.
```

## Bonus Features

1. Implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks.
